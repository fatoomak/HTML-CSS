<h1>parks around the world</h1>
<h2>Parks</h2>
<p>A park is an area of natural, semi-natural or planted space set aside for human enjoyment and recreation or for the protecion of wildlife  or natural habitats. Urban parks are</p>
<p>green spaces set aside for recreation inside towns and cities. National parks and country parks are green spaces used for recreation in the countryside. State parks and</p>
<p>provincial parks are administrated by sub-national government states and agencies. Parks may consist of grassy areas, rocks, soil and trees, but may also contain buildings and</p>
<p>other artifacts such as monuments, fountains or plaground structres. Many parks have feilds for playing sports such as baseball and football, and paved areas for games</p>
<p>such as basketball. Many parks have trails for walking, biking and other activities. Some parks are built adjacent to bodies of water or watercourses and may comprise a beach</p>
<p>or boat dock area, Urban parks often have benches for sitting and may cntain picnic tables and barbeque grills.</p><br>
<p>The largest parks can be vast natural areas of hundreds of thousands of square kilomitres(or square miles), with abundant wildlife and natural features such as mountains and</p>
<p>rivers. In many large parks, camping in tents is allowed with a permit. Many natural park are protected by law, and users may have to follow restrictions<e.g. rules against open</p>
<p>fires or bringing in glass bottles). Large national and sub-national parks are typically overseeen by park ranger. Large parks may have areas for canoeing and hiking in the</p>
<p>warmer months and, in some northern hemisphere countries, cross-country skiing and snowshoeing in colder months. There are also amusement parks wich have live shows,</p>
<p>fairground rides, refreshments, and games of chance or skill.</p><br>
<h2>Amusement parks</h2>
<p>An amusement park is a park that features various attractions, such as rides and games, as well as other events for entertainment purposes. A theme park is a type of</p>
<p>amusement park that bases its structures and attractions around a central theme, often featuring multiple areas with different themes. Unlike temporary and mobile funfairs and</p>
<p>carnivals, amusement parks are stationary and built for long-lasting operation. They are more elaborate than city parks and playgrounds, usually providing attractions that cater to</p>
<p>a variety of age groups. While amusement parks often contain themed areas, theme parks place a heavier focus with more intricately-designed themes that revolve around a</p>
<p>particular subject or group of subjects</p><br>
<p>Amusement parks evolved from European fairs, pleasure gardens and large picnic areas, which were created for people's recreation. World's fairs and other types of international</p>
<p>expositions also influenced the emergence of the amusement park industry.[2] Lake Compounce opened in 1846 and is considered the oldest, continuously-operating amusement</p>
<p>park in North America. The first theme parks emerged in the mid-twentieth century with the opening of Santa Claus Land in 1946, Santa's Workshop in 1949, and Disneyland in</p>
<p>1955.</p>
<h2>Disneyland</h2>
<p>Disneyland Park, originally Disneyland, is the first of two theme parks built at the Disneyland Resort in Anaheim, California, opened on July 17, 1955. It is the only theme</p>
<p>park designed and built to completion under the direct supervision of Walt Disney. It was originally the only attraction on the property; its official name was changed to</p>
<p>Disneyland Park to distinguish it from the expanding complex in the 1990s. It was the first Disney theme park.</p>
<p>Walt Disney came up with the concept of Disneyland after visiting various amusement parks with his daughters in the 1930s and 1940s. He initially envisioned building a</p>
<p>tourist attraction adjacent to his studios in Burbank to entertain fans who wished to visit; however, he soon realized that the proposed site was too small. After hiring a</p>
<p>consultant to help him determine an appropriate site for his project, Disney bought a 160-acre (65 ha) site near Anaheim in 1953. Construction began in 1954 and the</p>
<p>park was unveiled during a special televised press event on the ABC Television Network on July 17, 1955.</p>
<p>Since its opening, Disneyland has undergone expansions and major renovations, including the addition of New Orleans Square in 1966, Bear Country (now Critter</p>
<p>Country) in 1972, Mickey's Toontown inproducts 1993, and Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge in 2019.Opened in 2001, Disney California Adventure Park was built on the site of</p>
<p> Disneyland's original parking lot.</p><br>
<p>Disneyland has a larger cumulative attendance than any other theme park in the world, with 726 million visits since it opened (as of December 2018). In 2018, the park had</p>
<p>approximately 18.6 million visits, making it the second most visited amusement park in the world that year, behind only Magic Kingdom, the very park it inspired.</p>
<p>According to a March 2005 Disney report, 65,700 jobs are supported by the Disneyland Resort, including about 20,000 direct Disney employees and 3,800 third-party</p>
<p>account for higher attendance numbers.</p>
